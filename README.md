## Description
Leverages OpenAI's Doll-e-3 API to generate images based off a prompt. Uses tailwind for some basic styles, express for a back-end server and vanila JS for client side functionality.


## Developement
- Running locally: `npm start`
- Dev mode: `npm run dev` (launches start via nodemon), then in separate terminal `npm run tailwind:css` (applies styles in realtime as they are added)
